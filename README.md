# Unclosed Parenthesis in Function Definition

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  This seemingly minor mistake can cause significant problems, leading to a `SyntaxError` that can be difficult to debug.

The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code with the missing closing parenthesis.  The `bugSolution.py` file presents the corrected code. This simple example illustrates the importance of carefully reviewing code for syntax errors before running it.
